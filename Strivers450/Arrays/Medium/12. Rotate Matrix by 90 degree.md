[ 48. Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/)

### **How It Works**

#### 1. **Input and Output**

- **Input**:
  - A matrix (`matrix`) represented as a 2D array.
  - The number of rows (`rows`) and columns (`columns`) in the matrix.
- **Output**:
  - A new matrix (`result`) which is the original matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

#### 2. **Logic Breakdown**

1.  **Create an Empty Result Matrix**:

    javascript

    Copy code

    `let result = Array.from({ length: columns }, () => Array(rows).fill(null));`

    - The dimensions of the result matrix are swapped compared to the original:
      - The number of rows in the result matrix is the number of columns in the original.
      - The number of columns in the result matrix is the number of rows in the original.

2.  **Populate the Result Matrix**:

    javascript

    Copy code

    `for (let row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
  for (let col = 0; col < columns; col++) {
    result[col][rows - 1 - row] = matrix[row][col];
  }
}`

    - For each element in the original matrix:
      - The value at position `(row, col)` in the original is moved to `(col, rows - 1 - row)` in the result.
      - This mapping is based on:
        - `col` becomes the new row index in the rotated matrix.
        - `rows - 1 - row` becomes the new column index, reversing the row order to achieve the 90-degree rotation.

3.  **Return the Result Matrix**:

    javascript

    Copy code

    `return result;`

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Original Matrix:

javascript

Copy code

`const matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
];`

Resulting Rotated Matrix:

Copy code

`7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3`

### **Key Concepts**

1.  **Matrix Dimensions Change**:

    - For a matrix of size `rows x columns`, the rotated matrix will have dimensions `columns x rows`.

2.  **Index Mapping**:

    - Row becomes the column index.
    - Column is reversed and becomes the row index in the new matrix.

3.  **Swapping Rows and Columns**:

    - This logic flips the orientation of the elements to achieve the rotation.

---

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

1.  **Incorrect Dimensions for `result`**:

    - Ensure the result matrix has `columns` rows and `rows` columns.

2.  **Index Mapping Errors**:

    - Remember that `rows - 1 - row` reverses the row indices, critical for the clockwise rotation.

3.  **Misunderstanding Coordinate Transformation**:

    - Always visualize the index mapping `(row, col)` â†’ `(col, rows - 1 - row)`.

---

### **Advantages of This Approach**

1.  **Efficient**:

    - Uses simple loops and operates in `O(rows * columns)` time complexity.
    - Requires only a single pass through the matrix.

2.  **Clear Logic**:

    - The index transformation is straightforward and easy to reason about.

### **When to Use**

- Rotating grids or images in matrix form.
- Manipulating table-like data for visualization or analysis.
